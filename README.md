## My Game for the Ludum Dare 57

The theme was **Depths**.

I did not come up with anyhting good.

But here it is: *Crates of Hell*.

Everything except the music beat is made by me.
Beat is by Sosh & Mosh on BandLab


PS: I know the repo is called ludumDare25. Thats 'cause I wasnt thinking and its 2025...
